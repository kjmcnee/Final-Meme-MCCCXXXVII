This is a Final Fantasy style game which I created for a high school CS class.

Internet memes have infected your computer and it's up to you to destroy them!

The game has many features typical of a FF game such as:
-Battle system
-Random battles (with common enemies, which are Internet trolls in this game)
-Boss Battles
-Levelling system
-Items
-Stores and currency system

The game also has a save feature. The save file is encrypted using a simple method of XORing each character with a constant key and using the cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode of operation.

Notes:
This game contains references to old Internet memes. You have been warned.
The game has a poorly balanced difficulty, especially in the boss battles.
There is a bug in the battle system (in the AttackEnemy subroutine) that I wasn't able to fix before the due date. I occurs fairly rarely, so I just made it so that whenever it throws an error, the program just continues to the next turn. It will just appear to be a missed attack to the player.
